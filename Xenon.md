What are the things I like to tell Erik and Xenon?

> I want to thank you for your time for the interview. I did learn a lot in such a short period of time talking to you guys. I do agree that every professional developer should stay current by reading books, reading blogs and even listening to podcasts.
> I am aware of the tasks and the expectations that the role have. I am committed to step up and learn as much as I can to meet and even exceed those expectations.
> As I have said in my application I am keen on working with the bleeding edge C++ 11/14 technology, TDD and Software Development in general done right. This is a rare opportunity for C++ Developers.
> I am looking forward to hear from you guys again. Please inform me if you already made your decision on my application. Thanks.
