I am currently reading Javascript and JQuery book written by Jon
Duckett (not sure if this I spelt it correctly). There are a few
realizations that I got from reading the book. I just read a few pages
but the realisations are valid. 

1. The computer is a tool. It is dumb. I am the master of it. It is basically a slave. I tell the computer what I want it to do. To do that, I must know at least one programing language. 

2. Before jumping into ANY kind of programming, I have to identify what is my main goal. What is the task I want the computer to do. Then break it down. What are the steps, what are the requirements, in order to achieve that goal. 

The metaphor that the book used is a recipe. The end goal is to come up with a fried egg. What are the things I need to create a fried egg? What are the steps I need to take in order to have that fried egg.

Ingredients:
a. fresh egg
b. 3 tbsp of cooking oil
c. frying pan and ladle
d. stove
e. salt to taste

Steps:
1. heat the pan with some oil.
2. crack the egg open to the pre-heated pan.
3. cook for 2-3 minutes until the egg whites are set.
4. sprikle a pinch of salt.
5. using the ladle, transfer the egg onto a plate. 

Enjoy!

That's a little bit of programming for you in the world of cooking. It's slightly a bit different when you do programming but it's kind of the same too. Keep reading. 

The programming language is a tool to talk to the computer. As long as I know one really really well, I can use it to tell the computer what I want it to do. That's the biggest realisation to me today.
