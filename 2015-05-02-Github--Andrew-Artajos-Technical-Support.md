## What's an impressionable experience you've had with customer service/support, and why?

Twitter. I remember ranting over twitter about a bad experience I had with my previous telco. I have been with my mobile carrier for more than eight years. My mobile plan was about to expire and it was time to renew. I badly wanted an iPhone that time. When it was my time to request something from them, they did not deliver. 

I received a reply from twitter. Somebody listened. It was the competitor telco and they were willing to give me an even better iPhone model given that I'd transfer my business to them. I stopped by in one of their business centers and walked out with my iPhone. It was quick and painless. Me = a very happy customer. 

## Tell us about a time where you helped someone.

I was travelling with my big brother. This was the first time we travelled to the US. We were waiting at the gate in the airport for our flight from New York to LA.  We were in our mid-late twenties at the time and very naive. We were approached by a fellow countryman. Of course we entertained him, then come boarding time he asked us to carry one of his bags for him because he was concerned that he'd exceed the carry on baggage limit. At the gate I was set aside as a part of a routine check. At that moment I knew that we didn't do a right thing. For one thing the bag was heavy. It was filled with little bottles of perfumes when it was opened. If I were asked why am I carrying that much perfume on board, I didn't have any answer. If that were drugs I would be in prison until now. Good thing they didn't ask any questions. They let me through.

As a result, he was happy he saved a lot of money from possible excess baggage fees. I was happy too, I learned 
 a very important lesson which I carry until now. Never talk to strangers specially in the airport. They could be drug mules for all you know or worse -- sample perfume smugglers. 

## How would you describe what GitHub does to a non-technical person? 	

Github is like the faceboook for programmers. If your friends love posting pictures in Facebook, programmers like to post text files instead. You get more popular in facebook if the pictures you posted had many likes and comments. Same thing at Github, when you get more people 'fork' or make pull requests to your project you can say that's a post well done. 

Github is free to use as Facebook but what you post there is for everyone to see. Unless you pay Github to hide the ones that you deem private.

## What motivates you to work in support?

I like working in the support role because I get to sharpen both my technical and people skills.

I have a highly technical background having previously worked on development roles. I love the challenge of investigating, analysing, trying out different things, finding root cause of the issue. Then trying out possible solutions to resolve a client's issue on the spot. 

I also like the challenge of a client facing role. I get to interact with both the client and the technical team behind the product. Most of the time the challenge is managing the expectations of the customers and maintaining a good relationship with them.

I also like writing. In a support role you get to write less for computers (code). Instead, you write for people (support team members, users and customers). It is important to make yourself very clear while using few and simple words. This makes your job easier because you eliminate too much hand-holding on trivial issues.

Finally, working at support gives you a better point of view of the product.  You see it in the customer's point of view. Your insights are the most valuable ones to consider for the next software release.
