Senior Software Engineer
I just had an intense interview a while ago with Erik and partner at Xenon.
What stuck me in this interview is the definition of a SENIOR Software Engineer. 
He clearly said that what he considers a senior software engineer is the ability to take command of your text editor.
The text is editor is your bitch. You tell it what to do, and it does it for you. Just like an extension of your hand. 
As carpenters have their tools, the programmers have the text editor as their go to TOOL when doing their job. So it is a MUST that you know how to use it, use it fast, efficiently and you know it like the back of your hand.
Their code editor of their choice is none other than visual studio. They swear by it and they really think that hands down it is the most powerful text editor out their for developers to do their best work.
Some topics covered also are the ways they do their development work at Xenon. 
They don't want bugs -- nobody does. 
So they do it the right way the first time. 
How? by test driven development. They also do a lot of reading!!! This really resonates with me. I love reading almost everything and learning from the things I read. I like this job for the reading. There's also listening to podcasts, reading blogs, but mostly books. I hope they provide free technical books too!
I want to get a book on C++ 11/14 if that will make me a better programmer. I want to also learn a text editor well. I am using sublime text right now. I can begin with that. It will make me a better computer worker too. That said, I really have to upskill. Buy a book that I can read from cover to cover. Do the exercises. practice practice practice.
I want to be really really good in one thing. I think a better Software Engineer is well worth the effort. Now where's my bitch?
I still have roughly four minutes left. 
If I am not considered on this position, it's ok. I will still buy my C++ book. Take care of my craft and really study inside and out. Be really knowledgeable in doing the C++ stuff to prepare myself to more and more opportunities that are out there and will definitely come my way. I wont be wasting my time anymore on trivial stuff. There are books to really study from cover to cover and not just read them and forget about them. I am doing a good job in the JavaScript book. I should continue doing that until my C++ book comes in the mail. I shall ask mommy because I want to buy my C++ book. Imagine, if I invest my time reading this book, it will really pay in dividends in the future. Edward did this a few years back and he really flew! He got really good at it in just reading a few books
