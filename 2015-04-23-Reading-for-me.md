I love to read. I do it for two reasons. 

1. I read to be entertained.

Right now my book for this is David Sedaris' When you are engulfed in flames. Its entertainment value is very good. I am at 50% of the book, and I don't want it to end. Reading it made me laugh several times already. A very few books have that power on me. 

Although I read for my own etertainment, I also learn a lot from it. So I think this is the best kind of reading activity there is. You hit two stones in one reading.


2. I read to learn.

I am reading Javascript and JQuery to learn. It is a well made book taking in mind very novice users in the world of programming. The book is very visual and practical. It's very evident that designers made it. It is very well made. I borrowed this book from the library, and when I finish I think I want to own a personal copy. 

To date, I just read only a few pages. The concepts are very simple to grasp but VERY important. I am so glad to have picked up this book to remind myself the very purpose of what I am to achieve.

Computers are there to serve us, not the other way around.
