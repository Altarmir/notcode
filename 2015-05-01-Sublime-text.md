I am viewing some videos about Sublime text. The video is using a mac for the tutorial. It turned me off. He referred me to the documentation, so I am skipping the videos altogether and rely on reading the documentation instead.

The documentation looks very familiar as it was developed using Sphinx. I saw it in the bedrock project of Mozilla. Now it is being used here on Sublime text project as well. This tells you one thing, Sphinx is becoming some sort of an industry fad or later on can be a standard who knows. 

Learning Sphinx could pay dividends also in the future. But right now, I want to focus on using a text editor blazingly fast. I choose Sublime text. I am learning about Sublime text each day for 20 minutes. I hope that's enough.

Now off to my homework.

Sublime text uses boost library for regular expressions. This means Sublime text is written in C++.
