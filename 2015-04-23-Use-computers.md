Now that I got down my realisation. Now it's time to use the computer to my advantage. 

Some thoughts:

1. My github account
Github is designed for safekeeping files. Text files to be exact. It's just that people use it for code. I think no one explicitly says it should be used for just code. I can use github to store my writings. As long as it is in text format, it shouldn't be a problem right?

That's why I am writing this down using separate text files. I am planning to use my github account as a repository of my writings as well. Not just for code.

2. Sample code in tech books
I want to use the github account to store the sample code I download or create when I study text books such as Javascript and JQuery. It would be very helpful for me as I can go back to the things I have done and have learned. 

Why didn't I think of this in the past?

3. Jobsearch. 

I am currently looking for an IT job here in Melbourne. I am a developer. I code things. I USE the computer to do things for me. As a programmer, I should be able to use this very computer 

a. to search the jobs that I'd like to apply for.

b. to send out cover letters and resumes for me.

c. to gather some basic facts about the companies I am shorlisted for.

d. to help me prepare for a successful interview so I get the job.

4. Automate stuff

This should be the main purpose of my computer, do the stuff it can do while I sleep. I can run it and it woudl apply for me. I have found a good resource for this, it's discussed in Python. It is set to come out anytime this week. I shall grab a hold of that book and apply every concept I learned to the things I do with my computer.
