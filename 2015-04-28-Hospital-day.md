When dude woke up, she was in pain. She had a stomachache. I wondered if it hurt just like mine when I had one. Looks like the pain was more unbearable for her that she requested to be taken to an emergency room instead of just the normal GP. We went to the Werribee hospital with Lara and Vera. Good thing all the procedures done on dude were all free. Thank you Australian government for that. Back at home it would cost us a lot for those basic checks. Good thing, dude was sent home in a few hours time. She's still recovering from that painful ordeal. I really hope that it would improve and she'll be alot better by tomorrow when we wake up as if nothing happened. 

Despite the setback, I am still aware that I have to do my job as a job seeker on top of the added work I have to do. I have to tend to my children. I have to make sure that they are well taken care of when my wife is not able to do that. I cooked for them both lunch and dinner. Lunch was easy--I popped in some instant noodle packet into the boiling water and lunch was served. Dinner was a little bit tricky as involved raw meat and some slicing and chopping action. The result was still edible dinner in fact my family liked it. My eldest daughter liked it so much that she requests the same food for her lunch box tomorrow. That's a first for me. 

Today I just ordered a C++ book written by the man himself who invented the language Bjarne Stroustrup. I've been a C++ developer for over 10 years and it's only now that I read a book from the creator of C++ -- I feel like a sham making a living out of C++ without reading any books written by Bjarne Stroustrup. As I have envisioned my arrival here in Australia, it's like a rebirth. A chance to start all over again. Now, I'd like to set things straight. There are second chances. This time I want to do it right. I shall start by upskilling myself by reading. learning, and re-learning the things I have taken for granted over the years. This time it is deliberate. I want this and I am making a concious effort to better myself. I do this for me because I want to get better. The book is in transit now from Perth to Victoria. I just want to do a quick rant that books are so expensive here in this part of the world. A friend of mine once said that everything here in Australia is much more expensive. The only thing that is not is milk -- everything else will cost you an arm and a leg. That is why the pressure of getting a job really is in the back of your mind all the time. 

After this I shall continue to apply to dev job openings here. It's already the end of April. Next week we will usher in May. May is a hopeful month. It brings new opportunities for me and my family. I hope we could grab one this time.
