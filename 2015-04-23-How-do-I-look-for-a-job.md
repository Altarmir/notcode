This is in the purpose of automating the jobsearch process.

1. I go to seek.com.au or linked.com.au or <insert favorite jobsite here>

2. I type in my favorite search terms in the search box.

"Technical Support Analyst" or "C++ Senior Software Developer Engineer Python Perl Linux Agile"

* Setup accounts in all the jobsites that I see are the most effective.
* Setup up automatic mailers for the search terms I used.
* Setup folders in my email account so that it can filter "Technical support jobs" and "Developer jobs"
* This email list can be my input and start my work from there.

3. Narrow down search results by Location. Ideally I am looking for jobs in Melbourne or anywhere near me.

* This could be set in the search terms too

4. Given the filtered list, I start shorlisting the jobs that are most appealing to me.


5. From the shorlist, I pick one job opening.

6. For each job opening, I read the job ad, and list down the keywords.

7. I take note of the Requirements of the job.

8. I create a cover letter re-prashing the requirements of the job.

* I think this can't be automated. Yes in theory it can be but I might have difficulty doing that for this particular project. Let other software re-phrase it for me? Great idea!

9. I paste the keywords in the footer, I make the font small, and the font color white.

10. I create a resume replacing my specialities in the summary coming from the cover letter.

11. I paste in the keywords to the footer of the resume too. Font small, white in font color.

12. Send out my application to through the jobsite or to the job portal. 


With all these steps, 
What are the ones I can automate? 
How will I do it?
What are the tools I need to automate each step?
Will I use just one tool or a lot?
